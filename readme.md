# DSA in Python

This repository contains implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python. It also includes solutions to coding contest problems for practice and learning purposes.

## Contents

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Python implementations of essential algorithms including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more.
- **Coding Contest Solutions**: Solutions to problems from coding contests like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, etc. These solutions are organized by problem category and contest name.

## Usage

You can explore each directory to find specific implementations or contest solutions. Feel free to use and modify the code for learning and practice purposes.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have new algorithms, improved implementations, or more efficient solutions to existing problems, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
